                <p>
                    I'm a passionate software engineer with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Science from UNC Charlotte.
                    I have gained a strong foundation of software engineering skills through my education, as well as through creating several projects.
                    I enjoy breaking down complex problems and creating simple, efficient solutions, and I'm constantly learning new tools and technologies to expand my skill set.
                    I'm currently looking for entry-level software engineering opportunities where I can grow, contribute, and make a impact.
